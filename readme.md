## Preface

> If you find something hard to understand, _BLAME YOUR OWN LACK OF KNOWLEDGE!_ since you were first born knowing nothing, then you've learned. There’s so much you still don’t know. things that confuse you now, but later, you may see them clearly and understand. — Nahj al-Balagha, (Letters 31-35), by Imam Ali

### Background

I've started to develop passion for conceptual meanings like understanding and meaning in the high school.

but the turning point was when in a online class, the teacher classified a question with answer of about 2 pages long as "*very simple*", it got me thinking  that "*what is the real measurement of simplicity?"*

## Terms

- GoT (Graph of Thought) is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- GoK (Graph of Knowledge) is a Directed Graph (may have cycles too)
- SF: Straight-Forward
- *Thinking* means *sinking* ideas into the brain, where they grow unseen...

## Chapter 1; Venn Diagram of KLU

<div style="text-align: center; height: 300px;">
  <img src="./assets/compiled/KLU-ven.png" alt="ven diagram of Understanding VS Learning VS Knowing">
</div>

- **Knowing** (K): remembering, like parrot

- **Learning** (L): pattern matching (i.e. making particular neural connection between or in other words, "shortcuts"), ability to do basic pattern matching i.e. repeating tasks in predicted order. unable to reason new situations (problems)

- **Understanding** (U): ability to relate what you know and what you learnt, not useful without K since causes false conclusions.(Misunderstandings due to faulty connections). see [Tesla's quote](https://fixquotes.com/quotes/the-scientists-of-today-think-deeply-instead-of-1057.htm)

- KL: Mastery, i.e. skill

- KU: Synthesis, can solve problems and from new thoughts but requires time

- LU: A person learns patterns (L) intuitively (e.g., native speakers picking up grammar rules without being taught) And develops some level of understanding (U) from those patterns, Even without explicit knowledge (K)

- KLU: Alchemy, highest level of understanding. enabling combining and creation.

> Learning (L) refine Knowledge (K) through practice, Understanding (U)  feed back into improving Learning (L) (e.g., learning strategies  

> A student studying physics might start by memorizing formulas (K), practice solving problems (L), then grasp *why* those formulas work (U). KLU would let them invent a novel experiment or critique flawed theories.

## Chapter 2; How we [should] solve a problem

here's the steps that are being taken by almost everyone

0. **Focus**: highlight important parts and figure out *what is wanted*.
1. **Recall**: remember related information 🌟
2. **Relate**: make connection
3. **Reason/Calculate**: conclude or process
4. **Repeat**: repeat the process until you're done.
5. **Doubt**: explore the possibilities of other answers by assuming you're answer is wrong or you've missed something

--------

the last step is too abstract, I felt that all of nodes are not the same, they seem different in nature and their purpose. so I categortized them as:

- ⚫ black: **problem** or **sub-problem** or **goal**
- 🟣 purple: **recall**
- 🟢 green: **reason**
- 🟠 orange: **calculate** or **compute

**Edges** : Show connections (i.e., "Relates to" or "Builds on")

## Simple/Complex GoT

a GoT that has more fusion nodes, is more complex

### Fusion nodes

nodes that have in-edges more than 1

## Shallow/Deep GoT

## Weight of a GoT: Heavy-ness / light-ness

The more the width of the GoT more ideas involved or more options have to be considered, we use the term **heavy** for such GoT.

## solution to a problem

If a solution to a problem resembels the direction of edges between nodes similar to what the learner's mind, we say that the solution is _straight-forward_, on the other hand if the direction of edges between nodes for an solution to a does not exist between nodes or does not exists **directly** between the nodes in the learner's mind, then we say that the solution is not straight-forward or it is _Explorative_.

Thus the term straight-forward is subjective according to the learning material and the learner.

Note that just connecting 2 nodes are not important, the direction of the edge also matters. for example a language learner first looks at the word e.g. "camera", then translates it to his mother tongue e.g. Persian ("دوربین") and then translating, he imagines the real camera in his mind. but he may have trouble to do it vice verse i.e. seeing a camera and then finding its English word. it is true that the person probably can find the word _after some time_ but it is not **obvious** i.e. it's not present _directly_ in his GoK.

In the above case we say that the person "knows" that word, but he must think more and accordingly takes more time for him compared to another learner that the image of every word is associated along with the word in his mind.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

***we say that height of the node English "Camera" from Persian "دوربین" is high but not vice versa.***

## height of a node in GoT

think of GoT as Valley, and nodes as hills and Mountains. The more unconventional to get from a neighbours of a node to it, the more the height of it.

### hint

hints are trying to lower the height of the next node. it is the ability of teacher to try to make everything obvious (height of 0) for his students

## opinion on people's behaviour on social media

most people in social media want quick and easy conclusions, i.e. shallow and straight-forward directions. which most of the times appears to be incorrect and destructive. this behaviour is exactly opposite of what Quran want from us: `افلا تعقلون` i.e. `why don't you think [more]?`

## idea about creativity

> here what I mean by the word "create" is that makeing/producing something that the creator/author has not seen like it before.

to create something new, the person need to connect sometimes even unrelated nodes in his GoK in a way that makes sense. the feature of connecting no so obvious unrelated nodes in brain requires some level of forgetting since he or she must not consider all of the details about it and sometimes has to misremember or misinterpret the details about it. I didn't know that forgetting can be blessing.

I've read somewhere that creative people tend to forgot more, as their brain gets good at losing connection between nodes in KoG and even creating false connections between them.

by the definition, you might've guessed that creative work is not straight-forward.

## Why GoK per se is not enough

according to definition of straight-forward solution, one can implement a question that the GoK be completly useless (i.e. the connection between concepts not be present). 

In order to mitigate the above problem, one might suggest that adding a lots of edges between nodes (cross referencing) and this surely solves the problem but it will arise a worse problem; nobody can understand a super dense GoK, by looking at it!

In my experience a lot of problems have their own GoK.

Another solution would be to create different versions of GoK based on different aspects e.g. most important nodes be people, most important nodes be time-line, most important be based on specific features and so on ...

That is why tools like GoK of Obisidian software would not help much and they are rather a fancy feature to make people say _WOW!_

The real problem is that the GoK **must be placed in the person's brain**, not in the computer. computers are already good at storing and retriving data efficiently. we as the users of these apps were supposed to make our learning journey easier but now it is completly oppsoite.

I've tried implmenting a GoK app similar to [Kumu](https://kumu.io/) named [ReMS](https://github.com/hamidb80/rems) (Remembering Management System) and not only it was time-consuming, it would not help me understant better. sure the remembering got easier but it was mostly becuase of documenting stuff; and I even want to say that, it was _very shallow_ kind of remembering.

### On Mind Maps

the above assertion hold true for mind-mapping since GoK is a lot more powerful than mind-map.

I've asked DeepSeek AI to give opinion about mind maps if he were Richard Feyman. the result is actually impressive (some of them are rather funny):

> "Nature doesn’t organize itself into pretty radial diagrams. If your understanding can’t handle a little chaos, it’s not understanding—it’s interior decorating."

> "Mind maps are like tour buses: you see all the sights, but you never step into the street. Real thinking means getting lost sometimes."

> "Drawing a line between two ideas doesn’t mean you’ve connected them—any more than tying a string between two lampposts means you’ve invented the telegraph."

> "The best mind map is the one you crumple up and throw away—because you don’t need it anymore."

> "Drawing a mind map to understand physics is like painting a sailboat to learn the wind."

> "Knowledge isn’t a dot you can connect—it’s the fire that burns between them."

> "Understanding isn’t a tree. It’s a wildfire—and you’re supposed to be the arsonist."

### Benefits

well in my opinion the only benefit of using GoK or Mind maps is that you kinda see the structure of the content and gives a whole overview; but the benefits stops here...



## Demo

I've developed an app to kinda see my theory in aciton.

- simple and easy:
  
  - drinking water

- simple but hard:
  
  - converting date system in all images in a folder
  - lifting heavy weight
  - coding a graphical game in assembly

- complex but easy:
  
  - solving a quadradic equation ( has considarble amount of steps but once you get it, it's easy )
  - coding in Python (sorry), you actually shoot your foot when coding python, happy debugging
