## Bluri's steps to solve a problem

0. **Focus**: highlight important parts and figure out *what is wanted*.
1. **Problem Differentiation**: determine related concepts involving in the problem.
2. **Recall**: remember related information about the previos attempts.
3. **Relate**: try to make connection between the previous attempts.
4. **Reason/Calculate**: try to conclude or process previous attemps to extract new results.
5. **Repeat**: repeat the process until you're done.
6. **Doubt**: explore the possibilities of other answers by assuming you're answer is wrong or you've missed something
7. Documentation formats:

## Bluri's theory to indicate complexity of a problem
the height of graph of thought (GoT) reperesents the complexity of the problem. the more the height of the graph, means that solving it requires *more steps* and hence is more complex.

The more the width of the graph of thougth means more ideas involved or more options have to be considered.
